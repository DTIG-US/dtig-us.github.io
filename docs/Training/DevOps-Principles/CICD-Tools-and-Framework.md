The first thing you need is a CI/CD tool. Jenkins, an open source, Java-based CI/CD tool based on the MIT License, is the tool that popularized the DevOps movement and has become the de facto standard.

So, what is Jenkins? Imagine it as some sort of a magical universal remote control that can talk to many many different services and tools and orchestrate them. On its own, a CI/CD tool like Jenkins is useless, but it becomes more powerful as it plugs into different tools and services.

Jenkins is just one of many open source CI/CD tools that you can leverage to build a DevOps pipeline.
