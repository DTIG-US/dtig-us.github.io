Queues help you to organize, prioritize, and monitor the progress of your work. In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, queues are containers used to store anything that needs to be completed or requires an action, for example completing a task or closing a case.

Queues can be useful in:

- Having a centralized list of pending work that needs attention
- Sorting tasks by type or by the people assigned to complete them

Use queues to categorize and prioritize your activities and cases. You can categorize based on:

- Different products or services
- Different subscription levels (regular, premium customers)
- Various activity categories
- Different geography
